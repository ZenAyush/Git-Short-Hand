Hello, today i am learning git from Harry Bhai videos.

## Git Commands

Use these commands to use git.


The "git status" command is used to show the current status of your Git repository. It will show you which files are staged for commit, which files have been modified but not yet staged, and which files are untracked.


```bash
git status
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "a commit msg"
```

```bash
git push -u origin master
```
